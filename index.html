      <h3>How to Use:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Input Your Fleet Details 🚢
          <p>Enter the number of ships, average voyage length, daily fuel consumption, and current fuel price.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Adjust the Estimated Savings Percentage 🌱
          <p>The calculator estimates fuel savings between 4% to 10%, based on real-world results from Wayfinder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>See Your Savings 📊
          <ul>
            <li>Total Fuel Cost (Current) 💰</li>
            <li>Estimated Savings (USD) 💸</li>
            <li>Fuel Cost with Wayfinder 🔧</li>
            <li>CO₂ Emissions Reduction (MT) 🌎</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Assumptions Made in This Calculator ⚙️</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Fuel Consumption is Based on Daily Averages ⛽</b>
          <p>The calculator assumes a constant fuel consumption rate (MT/day) for the entire voyage duration.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Fuel Price is Static 💰</b>
          <p>The fuel price entered is considered fixed for the voyage. Fluctuations in fuel prices are not accounted for.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Estimated Savings Range 🌱</b>
          <p>The fuel savings percentage is estimated between 4% to 10%, based on typical results from Sofar Ocean's Wayfinder platform. Actual savings may vary depending on weather conditions, route complexity, and vessel type.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>CO₂ Emissions Reduction 🌎</b>
          <p>The calculator assumes that each metric ton of fuel burned produces 3.15 metric tons of CO₂, based on standard shipping industry benchmarks.</p>
