      <h2>Sofar Ocean Fuel Savings Calculator – How It Works 💡</h2>
      <p>This calculator helps shipping companies estimate potential fuel cost savings and CO₂ emissions reductions by using Sofar Ocean's Wayfinder platform for optimized voyage planning.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>How to Use:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Input Your Fleet Details 🚢</strong><br>Enter the number of ships, average voyage length, daily fuel consumption, and current fuel price.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Adjust the Estimated Savings Percentage 🌱</strong><br>The calculator estimates fuel savings between 4% to 10%, based on real-world results from Wayfinder.</li>
        <li><strong>3. See Your Savings 📊</strong><br>The calculator will automatically show:
          <ul>
            <li>Total Fuel Cost (Current) 💰</li>
            <li>Estimated Savings (USD) 💸</li>
            <li>Fuel Cost with Wayfinder 🔧</li>
            <li>CO₂ Emissions Reduction (MT) 🌎</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Assumptions Made in This Calculator ⚙️</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fuel Consumption is Based on Daily Averages ⛽</strong><br>The calculator assumes a constant fuel consumption rate (MT/day) for the entire voyage duration.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Price is Static 💰</strong><br>The fuel price entered is considered fixed for the voyage. Fluctuations in fuel prices are not accounted for.</li>
        <li><strong>Estimated Savings Range 🌱</strong><br>The fuel savings percentage is estimated between 4% to 10%, based on typical results from Sofar Ocean's Wayfinder platform. Actual savings may vary depending on weather conditions, route complexity, and vessel type.</li>
        <li><strong>CO₂ Emissions Reduction 🌎</strong><br>The calculator assumes that each metric ton of fuel burned produces 3.15 metric tons of CO₂, based on standard shipping industry benchmarks.</li>
